# josue-lopez (Blogasaurus)

This is a simple web application that hosts a blog with comments, an interactive career timeline, and a digital photo gallery. It is a project that sprung from the educational curriculum used at Google's 2017 [Computer Science Summer
Institute](https://edu.google.com/resources/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/) in Seattle, WA.

I work on this app at irregular intervals. The code for each stage is available as a separate branch in this Git repository.

This app now runs on [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/python-support). To run it locally, download [Python 3.6.0 â‰¤ 3.6.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/), download this repository, navigate to the `/josue-lopez` directory using the commandline, and run `$ python main.py`.

This is not an official Google product.
