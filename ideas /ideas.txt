To add a section of Food Blogs, where I talk about my experiences 
of cooking my favorite foods and recipes.

These blogs html pages will be modularized, just like NodeJS Express HBS

there will be an overall LAYOUT:

- also, the "views/pages/blog1.hbs" will follow the outline:

1. Title of Food
1.5. Date (import datetime?)
2. What do you think about this recipe? How much do you like it? How did you come across it?
3. A PICTURE
4. The items I used: Nicely styled Bulleted List
5. Procedures: A youtube video
6. Cordial thank you note
